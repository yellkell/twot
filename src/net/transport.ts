/**
 * Transport abstraction: how PeerMessages reach the other boxer. The game

 *  - wsTransport     — the bundled WebSocket relay (lowest latency when
 *                      hosted near both players; also the LAN/dev default).
 *  - webrtcTransport — serverless: Firebase Firestore for matchmaking +
 *                      signaling, then true peer-to-peer RTCDataChannels.
